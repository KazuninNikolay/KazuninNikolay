### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my mame is Nikolay.

#### I'm a Java developer.


Since 2023, I began to actively study Java and completed the JavaRush course under the Java Developper Professional program.

During this time I have studied a lot of technologies, and I am not going to stop there.

- [CRUD project using Hibernate.](https://github.com/KazuninNikolay/project-hibernate-1)
- [In this project I am performing tasks to change and add functionality to the SpringBoot application.](https://github.com/KazuninNikolay/project-final-jira-rush)
